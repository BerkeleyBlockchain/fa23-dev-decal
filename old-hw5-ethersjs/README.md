### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Using ethers.js

You have to add in a contract ABI into the ABI folder, and then change two files for this hw, the header.tsx has a connect wallet function that you should fill in, and the contracts.tsx needs to be filled in to make a contract call.

This should call your contract from the ABI file which you will have to import at the top for those unfamiliar with web dev. Lastly you will upload a screen recording of your site successfully connected to metamask and calling your contract. Please go to etherscan and show us that your wallet successfully called the contract

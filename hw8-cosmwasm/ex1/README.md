### Ex 1: A Gentle Intro to CosmWasm

## Overview
CosmWasm is a smart contract platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. It allows you to write high performance and secure smart contracts in a multitude of languages which compile to 
Wasm
. For the time being, CosmWasm contracts are written in Rust (but soon Golang and other languages), so you'll need some working knowledge of Rust.

While it can be fairly intimidating at first glance, once it clicks you'll be a certified Rust evangelist and thereâ€™s no looking back. ðŸ™ƒ

To speed you on your journey, the following resources can be of help:
- Rust Resources
- Rust Documentation
- Rust Book
- Rust by Example
- Do the Rustlings Course
- Rust Playground
- CosmWasm Resources
- CosmWasm Standard Library Documention
- CosmWasm Book
- Sylvia Book
- CosmWasm Academy
- Awesome CosmWasm
- Legacy CosmWasm Documentation \

Your interplanetary journey will begin in the next exercise by constructing a teleporter contract called a "Jump Ring", but before we get to that, let's warm up with a simple hello to our fellow Rustaceans across the Cosmos...


## Exercise
The following exercise is a spin-off of the 
"Hello World!" project
 from 
Rust by Example
. No trickery is involved but, if you happen to struggle with it, you'll want to first research the above resources before starting to build your Jump Ring teleporter in the next exercise.

1. Using the println macro, add code to print the contents of hello_msg.
2. Using the println macro, add code to print the contents of species_msg.
